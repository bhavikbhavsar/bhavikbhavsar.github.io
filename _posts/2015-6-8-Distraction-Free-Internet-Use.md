**Q: Is there any way to study on the internet without getting distracted?**

> ## **IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO BE BUSY
We must ask: What are we busy About ? - Henry David**

The problem everyone faces in this digital era is the constant distraction from various sites on the internet. You are researching on a particular topic, finding some answers, understanding few concept and the next thing you remember what was I actually searching for. This phenomeon has become common for all of us now.



To overcome these weapons of mass distraction, we must plan our actions well in advance.

### Plan A (Block them entirely)
Block the most time consuming sites in the hosts file.
 
 For Windows
1. Open Notepad and click File –> Open
2. Open up the following file:  C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC\HOST
3. To block your time-wasting sites, type in the following: 127.0.0.1 facebook.com
4. Repeat step 3 until you’ve entered all your time-wasting sites
5. Save the file and close
 
 For Linux/Mac (same steps edit file /etc/hosts)

### Plan B(Block time wasting site for certain period of time)

Few good Plugins for your Chrome/Firefox browser
